                    <pp>Grand City was created by an ambitious investor named Tjung Sun Liong<br>
                         on 12th December 2012, while its grand opening falls on 19th November 2021.<br>
                          The <b>Grand</b> mall <i>*pun intended*</i>, are a spacious one with approximately <br>
                          250,000 sqm land areas and a hefty 10 stories high to its name. Created with<br>
                           the help from a world-known architect and business consultant, Wirawan<br>
                            Ekaputra. Despite has only been open to public in the last year, Grand <br>
                            City as we say right now is a top choice among the public, and also the critics.<br>

                        categories, one of which is <b>' The Future Mall '</b> by<b> Brew & On The Hill.co</b>.<br>
                        Or a more reknown one such as, the winning of<b> The Most Enchanting &<br>
                         Captivating Design Award</b> by <b>Europe Art & Property Design </b> in January 2022.<br>
                        Even though these awards and achievements are sure a fool-proof way to mark<br>
                         progress, the Grand City Head Department has never stop to try and always<br>
